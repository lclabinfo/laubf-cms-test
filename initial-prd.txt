📄 PRD: Church Website CMS & Builder
David Brad Lim - Last Updated Dec 19, 2025
🚩 Problem
Small churches are often maintained by one pastor or a very small admin team (1–2 people) whose primary focus is ministry, not website management.

Keeping the website accurate requires frequent updates to sermons, Bible studies, announcements, and events. Today, this work feels like design work rather than content work: admins must judge what is safe to edit, worry about breaking layouts, and rely on memory to keep information current—despite limited time and design experience.

Over time, this leads to stale content, lingering announcements, inconsistent documents, and a website that feels “fixed in time,” even when the ministry is active. This is not a motivation issue but a system mismatch: church admins think in ministry artifacts, not pages or layouts. A CMS that requires managing structure creates friction, anxiety, and long-term decay.

The core problem to solve:
How might we enable time-constrained, non-design church admins to keep the website accurate, current, and trustworthy—without requiring them to think about design or layout decisions?

👤 Target Use Cases & Tasks
Primary User: Church Admin / Pastor
(Typically 1–2 people, non-designers, time-constrained)
As a church admin, I want to keep the website content accurate and up-to-date with minimal effort, so the church consistently appears active and trustworthy without requiring constant attention.
As a church admin, I want to manage church content based on ministry artifacts rather than web pages, so the CMS reflects how I actually work week to week.
As a church admin, I want confidence that making updates will not break the website, so I can publish changes without fear or extra verification work.
As a church admin, I want template and design changes to be intentional and separate from everyday content work, so customization does not interfere with weekly maintenance.
As a church admin, I want the CMS to help prevent content from becoming outdated, so the website does not slowly decay over time.
As a church admin, I want Bible study materials and documents to upload and display cleanly by default, so I don’t need to fix formatting issues manually.
As a church admin, I want the CMS to support multiple admins safely, so responsibilities can be shared without risking inconsistency or breakage.
As a resource-limited church, I want flexibility in how much customization we use, so the platform can grow with us without forcing complexity upfront.



🎯 Proposed Solution
Goals
Reduce Admin Cognitive Load
Allow admins to update content as part of weekly ministry routines
Eliminate the need to understand pages, layouts, or design systems
Prevent Website Decay at the System Level
Ensure outdated content does not persist unintentionally
Make “freshness” the default behavior, not an admin responsibility
Align CMS Structure with Real Church Workflows
Treat sermons, Bible studies, announcements, and events as first-class artifacts
Optimize for the most frequent admin actions (Bible study uploads, announcements)
Enable Safe Customization Without Risk
Support template selection and customization without affecting daily workflows
Allow deeper customization only through intentional, gated actions
Editing Flexibility
While the CMS defaults to template-powered editing for safety and consistency, it also supports controlled free-form page editing for churches that require flexibility.
Admins can create custom pages that allow section-based editing (adding text, media, and predefined blocks) without requiring design expertise. This ensures churches are not blocked by rigid structures, while still preventing the risks and complexity of a fully free-form website builder.
Scale Beyond a Single Maintainer
Support multiple admins safely
Minimize onboarding and training overhead
Maintain consistency during leadership or role transitions

Non-goals
We are not building a fully free-form, pixel-level website builder.
We are not optimizing the CMS primarily for professional designers or agencies.
We are not exposing low-level design or layout controls (e.g., grids, breakpoints, CSS).
We are not requiring admins to understand technical concepts such as templates, instances, or components.
We are not treating all pages as equally flexible; core artifact-driven pages remain template-governed.

Success Metrics / Measurable Outcomes
TBD // need user interviews for this

1. Core Content Workflows (CMS: Ministry Artifacts)
This section includes church-specific CMS components with specialized functionality. These components are typically custom-built for each client, or selected from a curated set of prebuilt options. The goal is to support common church workflows and standardize them into structured processes, rather than treating them as generic CMS content. Because they are workflow-driven, these sections offer less customization than other CMS areas.

1.2 Bible Study Materials
TODO: Need to think about if this should also be generalized to “Documents” or “Files” -> but then this feels pretty specific and I’m not sure what other uploads would happen here. In this case, we’ll probably need to consider a case where this selectively appears if the church needs it? Even think about a selective menu addition / deletion. Or even consider different interface per church that is custom — similar to how Tithe.ly is managing custom ChMS it seems.
