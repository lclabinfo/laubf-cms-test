## Who They Are

**Role:** Church Admin / Pastor (often the same person)

**Team size:** Typically 1-2 people responsible for the entire church's digital presence

**Technical skill:** Non-designers, non-developers. Comfortable using basic web tools (email, Google Docs, YouTube) but not comfortable with website builders, design systems, or code.

**Primary job:** Ministry — preaching, pastoral care, community leadership. Website management is a secondary responsibility they inherit by necessity, not by choice.

## Core Constraints

| Constraint | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Time** | Extremely limited. Website updates compete with sermon prep, counseling, event planning, and administrative duties. |
| **Design confidence** | Low. They fear breaking the website when making changes and avoid edits they're unsure about. |
| **Technical vocabulary** | They think in ministry artifacts (sermons, Bible studies, announcements, events) — not in pages, layouts, sections, or components. |
| **Team transitions** | Leadership changes happen. The system must remain usable without institutional knowledge or onboarding. |
| **Budget** | Resource-limited. Churches, especially smaller ones, need affordable and proportionate tooling. |

## Mental Model

Church admins think about their website in terms of **what happened this week in ministry** — not in terms of web pages:

- "I need to post this week's sermon."
- "Bible study materials are ready, I need to upload them."
- "The men's retreat is next month, I need to put it on the calendar."
- "Last week's announcement about the potluck is still showing — it already happened."

They do **not** think:
- "I need to update the hero section on the homepage."
- "I should rearrange the grid layout on the events page."
- "Which template component should I use for this content block?"

## User Stories

1. As a church admin, I want to keep the website content accurate and up-to-date with minimal effort, so the church consistently appears active and trustworthy without requiring constant attention.

2. As a church admin, I want to manage church content based on ministry artifacts rather than web pages, so the CMS reflects how I actually work week to week.

3. As a church admin, I want confidence that making updates will not break the website, so I can publish changes without fear or extra verification work.

4. As a church admin, I want template and design changes to be intentional and separate from everyday content work, so customization does not interfere with weekly maintenance.

5. As a church admin, I want the CMS to help prevent content from becoming outdated, so the website does not slowly decay over time.

6. As a church admin, I want Bible study materials and documents to upload and display cleanly by default, so I don't need to fix formatting issues manually.

7. As a church admin, I want the CMS to support multiple admins safely, so responsibilities can be shared without risking inconsistency or breakage.

8. As a resource-limited church, I want flexibility in how much customization we use, so the platform can grow with us without forcing complexity upfront.

## Key Behaviors to Design For

- **Weekly routine updates** — sermon posting, Bible study uploads, announcement creation. These are the highest-frequency tasks.
- **Seasonal event management** — conferences, retreats, holiday services. Periodic but high-stakes (public-facing, time-sensitive).
- **"Set and forget" content** — church profile, ministry pages, about us. Updated rarely but must stay accurate.
- **Passive maintenance** — the system should handle content freshness (auto-expiring announcements, archiving past events) so admins don't have to remember.
